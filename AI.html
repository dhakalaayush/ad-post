<p class = "intro">A self driving car can detect the motion of vehicles and other obstacles around 
    the road and gets driven on its own. The car doesn't have senses like us. So, how does it do 
    it? This is Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence, in short called AI, is the 
    intelligence of machines created by human. It is a technology that enables machines to think and 
    work like human. 
</p>
<h1>How AI works</h1>
<p class = "intro">AI is a component of machine learning. It is important to note that although all 
    machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning. AI requires specialized hardware and 
    software and algorithms. Generelly, AI system works by consuming data, analyzing it and give 
    output. These systems are trained to analyze the datas. Programmers would define AI as a set of 
    algorithms. So, when the machine is fed with data, it goes through the programmed algorithm 
    and gives the output. This means the development of AI is basically the idea of finding out 
    the better algorithms to program the machine. Hardware plays an important role in AI as well. 
    Development of hardware is also significant in development of AI.
   The idea of humanoid robot may be that when the hardware system recognizes the surrounding, i.e 
   voice or motion, the robot may be programmed and trained to analyze that sense and give the 
   necessary output.

<p class = "intro">Like human initelligence, the artificial intelligence also has a set of 
    skills that help to develop it.
</p>
<ol type = "1">
    <li class = "intro">Learning</li>The AI learns from the fed data and programmed algorithm. 
    Algorithm are the rules for AI. It has to work following those rules. It has to learn 
    to analyze data and solve problems. 
    <li class = "intro">Reasoning</li>The AI has to choose right step to solve a problem. This 
    aspect includes it to select the right algorithm to process. Algorithm is a set of 
    instructions. Right algorithm is to be chosen to give right result.
    <li class = "intro">Correction</li>AI should be able to correct itslef to give accurate results. 
    Training AI system includes correcting the system every time it flows through the 
    wrong algorithm.
    <li class = "intro">Networking</li>AI uses the internet to give informations. The AI generated 
    images are the images that the AI system extracts from the internet and processes it to make a 
    different type of image. Today's AI systems are so well-trained that they process these images 
    efficiently and give a nice different AI generated image.
    <li class = "intro">Perception</li>Hardware is also important in AI system. Perception is 
    the ability of AI system to sense the surrounding via hardwares. VOice recognition, face 
    recognition, motion sensing, etc are all perception of machine.
</ol>

<h1>Applications</h1>
<p class = "intro">AI is applcable in many technological areas. This includes search engines, content
    recommendation system in social media, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, language translator, 
    speech recognition, face recognition, automatic vehicles, image labelling and many others. 
</p>
<p class = "intro">AI is being popular in movies. CGI has developed with now AI being helpful in 
    motion tracking, face recognition and so many more features. This means we can shoot an entire 
    movie in a single hall, varying backgrounds and objects being shown on the screen. The faces of 
    actors can also be modified and this is a huge step to modern film industries. A movie can be 
    filmed by using a person whose face can be changed into that of an actor. So, the actor, without 
    having to do any work, got the face in the movie. This also means that the people who have died 
    can be shown on the screen again.

</p>
<p class = "intro">Gaming applications have also been using AI. In 1997, Deep Blue, a computer chess 
    game program defeated Garry Kasparov, the best chess player back then. Nowadays, every video game 
    is AI-based. AI can easily build a character in the game which is controlled like a human. Example, 
    in war games, not every players we see are simulated by people playing the game. Some of them, which 
    people refer as 'bots' are AI characters. 
</p>
<p class = "intro">One of the interesting subjects in the field of Artificial Intelligence humanoid 
    robots. People have developed many humanoid robots and are working to improve them. We have started 
    to see these human-like robots in factories, restaurants and hospitals. These robots in fes years  
    time will be like a new species, which may be more intelligent than human. They can be used to do 
    works which human cannot do. Being a machine, they are dillegent, versatile and more accurate 
    than human so they will perform many works better than us. We can use them in militaries to experiment 
    with weapons and hospitals to accurately measure data and do complex tasks.

<h1>The Future</h1>
<p class = "intro">There are major concerns regarding the future of Artificial Intelligence. 
    The positive aspects are huge. The development of AI will benefit in the advancement 
    of technology. It will potentially revolutionize industries, research area and our daily 
    lifestyle. It will also assist in medical discoveries. The development of AI has direct 
    relationship with various scientific fields. 
    The dependency of AI in our daily lives is likely to be increasing as well.
    The vast  scope of AI will benefit infinite areas of humanity. But the ethical subject is 
    the thing that determines the path of AI to the future. AI is promising prospect to solve the
     years of difficulties that the mankind have faced 
    there also arises the responsibilty of handling this technology. AI aren't properly trained 
    and tested. So we cannot guarantee anything from them. The development of AI will require 
    feeding them with different informations, datas and whatsoever. 
    This means a machine will store every informations, whether it is political, financial or a 
    national issue. This also means whent the machine is accessed by someone else, the privacy is 
    destroyed, the nation's secret agenda is made public. 
    The nation's finance is disrupted. When we start to become more and more dependent on machines, 
    the problems will rise. The cybersecurity might not be able to handle these problems. 
    It is certainly possible to lead AI to build a luxurious future but it is very difficult that 
    even a small unnotoceable error can lead to huge problem and we cannot trust the hands that are 
    building it.</p>
<img src = "jobdisplacement.png" class = "name">
<p class = "intro">Job displacement might be a noticeable problem we can expect from AI. 
    Machines, being more efficient and versatile, can replace human at different jobs. Also, due 
    to the technology in movies and music, the original artists might get replaced as well. We can 
    create a graphics, presentation or a music by AI. Moreover, we can make a new music with the 
    voice of an artist, without actually including the real artist in the process. This is a feature even 
    YouTube is working on. We can build computer programs by AI. In the future we might be able to make 
    an application by AI which will be better than that built by human. There are many what ifs and many 
    predictions. This will all depend on how we drive the AI technology and how we maintain it in 
    the future.

<div class = "rightbox">
Many people are excited by AI, considering it to be the greatest achievement in mankind and imagining 
it fantastic possibility, while some fear it and claims to be the ending of human species. In either way, 
AI is destined to be the revolution in the world and it depends on us how it would shape the future. 
We might have someone efficient to work for us. We might ride in a driverless car. We might live 
with another species. The possibilities are endless and its about time we experience that.
